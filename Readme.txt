This plugin creates the \"Documents\" page to see a list of the titles of all the Documents and also create the \"Thematics\" page to view the list of Documents through the  categories.

== Description ==
This plugin is made with the idea of having a \"Document Manager\" for which we use: custom post types, taxonomies and tags. To view a list of titles and thematics two pages protected with a password are created.

This plugin creates the \"Documents\" page to see a list of the titles of all the Documents and also create the \"Thematics\" page to view the list of Documents through the  categories.

You can change the name of these pages but \"ALERT\" do not modify your SLUG (permalink | enlace permanente). 

The plugin creates an \"Uncategorized\" thematic and a \"Document\" tag. To obtain better search results you must add in categories the categories you think appropriate and the same in Tags.

The images and documents must be uploaded to the Library and in the Details Documents entry set the URL that corresponds to each one.

The size of the images is set to 150 px. (You can upload them larger but they will be reduced automatically).

If the list of Documents is not visible, go to \"Settings / Permalinks\" and click on \"Save Changes\".

If in the list of Documents there are titles like: Auto Draft | Borrador automático, the solution to eliminate these results is to install the Plugin \"WP-Sweep\" (https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-sweep/) activate and run the plugin. This plugin cleans the database.

To protect your Documents we recommend using the \"Members\" plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/)
